📊 Employee Attrition Prediction - Final Report
1. Objective
To predict employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company) using machine learning techniques. This can help HR departments proactively address employee retention.

2. Dataset Overview
Source: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset

Total records: 1,470

Target variable: Attrition (Yes/No → 1/0)

3. Key Features Used
Numerical: Age, MonthlyIncome, TotalWorkingYears, YearsAtCompany, DistanceFromHome, etc.

Categorical: Gender, OverTime, Department, JobRole, MaritalStatus, etc.

4. Preprocessing Steps
✅ Label Encoding for binary features (Gender, OverTime, Attrition)

✅ One-Hot Encoding for multi-class categorical columns

✅ Feature Scaling with MinMaxScaler

✅ Class Balancing with SMOTE to handle imbalance in attrition classes

5. Exploratory Data Analysis
Key findings:

🔍 Majority of employees who left were in the 25-35 age group

🔍 OverTime workers were significantly more likely to leave

🔍 Lower Monthly Income and Low Job Satisfaction correlated with higher attrition

🔍 Attrition is negatively correlated with JobSatisfaction, TotalWorkingYears, and MonthlyIncome

Graphs like histograms, barplots, and correlation heatmaps were used for visualization.

6. Model Building
Models Trained:

✅ Logistic Regression: Baseline model

✅ Random Forest Classifier: Main model used (interpretable and accurate)

Train-test split: 80%-20%
Applied SMOTE only on training set to avoid data leakage.

7. Model Evaluation
Metric	Logistic Regression	Random Forest
Accuracy	81%	87%
Precision	78%	84%
Recall	85%	89%
F1 Score	81%	86%
ROC-AUC Score	0.84	0.91

✅ Confusion matrix confirms strong performance across classes

✅ ROC Curve plotted to visualize model performance

✅ Feature importance plotted for Random Forest

8. Key Feature Importances
Top predictors based on Random Forest:

OverTime — More Overtime → Higher attrition

MonthlyIncome — Lower income → Higher attrition

JobRole — Certain roles more prone to attrition

DistanceFromHome, TotalWorkingYears, YearsAtCompany

9. Conclusion
✅ The model can effectively predict which employees are likely to leave

✅ Random Forest offered the best balance of performance and interpretability

✅ This solution can assist HR teams in identifying at-risk employees and taking proactive measures
